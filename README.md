# Features:

You can get into editor mode to write notes, and outside the editor mode, you can change statuses of them, and move around with the cursor.

## Notes statuses:

`[O]` : no status

`[X]` : task done

Statuses below are to show if a feature of your product is added or removed/deleted:

`[-]` : item removed

`[+]` : item added

Imagine this being the terminal, here is notes of a game:

```txt

[O] Add new enemy sprite

[+] Rocket launchers

[-] Zombies

[X] New player sprite

[O] Finish drawing the background of the store scene
